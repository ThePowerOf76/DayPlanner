NAME
	DayPlanner - a simple app for planning days for very undecisive people.
SYNOPSIS
	java -jar DayPlanner.jar
	java -jar DayPlanner.jar (-n | --no-gui) (-v | --verbose) 
	java -jar DayPlanner.jar (-h | --help) 
DESCRIPTION
	DayPlanner is a simple app for planning your day from now up to a certain hour.

	It starts by default in a GUI mode, which can be changed using the --no-gui parameter, causing the app to launch 
	in text mode(referred to as TTY mode from now on). The functionality remains the same, but with the default environment 
	being the terminal.							
	--verbose parameter is used to display additional debug information, both in GUI and TTY mode.
	--help displays this page.
	Inside, the app has support for multiple different lists. The first action after launching the app is to pick 
	the list on which to operate. You can do so by selecting the appropriate list from the drop-down menu and clicking
	the "Load" button in GUI mode or typing the number from the list in TTY mode. The list will be loaded into the internal 
	memory of the program and will be ready to be operated on. If no list has been created yet, the user will be prompted to 
	create one, using the "Add List" function described below.

	The next menu is the operation menu. In GUI mode, individual options can be used by clicking the appropriate button and
	in TTY mode, the options have to be typed in, as shown in the quotation marks. The input here is not case-sensitive, so
	arguments will get accepted even if case is not exact.
	
	"Generate" will generate a list of activities from the list picked in the first step.
	It takes the following input: 
		-Hour which to end generation on(inputted in 24h format as a simple number, that is 1, 12, 21 etc.)
		-Whether to use Pomodoro technique(triggered by typing true or false). In that case, the activity time will be
	set to 20 minutes and break time will be set to 5 minutes. If this argument is true, the next 2 arguments are ommitted.
		-Activity length(in minutes)
		-Break length(in minutes)
	The app will then generate the list of activities, followed by breaks of defined length, until the hour from the first 
	parameter. It is displayed in the following format:
		H1:M1 T - H2:M2 T: A
		H2:M2 T - H3:M3 T: B
					H- hour
					M- minute
					T- AM/PM 
					A- Activity name
					B- Break
	"Add" will append an entry to the list. 
	It accepts only one parameter and that is the entry in question. The entry is appended on the end of the list and sync it
	with the file. 

	"Modify" allows the user to change a specific entry. 
	In GUI mode the user selects the entry to modify from a drop-down menu, inputs the substitute into the text field and 
	confirms with "Modify" button. In TTY mode, the user is displayed a list of all entries, types in the number of the entry 	
	to modify and then the new entry to substitute. The list and the file get updated immediately.

	"Delete" allows the user to delete an entry from the list.
	Functions the same way as "Modify", without the new entry to substitute.

	"Add List" will add a new list to the list picker and create a new file to hold the entries with the same name. 
	Afterwards, the user will be prompted to add a few entries to the list. Works the same as the "Add" function.

	"Modify List" changes a list in the list picker's and it's corresponding file's name. Works the same as the "Modify"
	function. 
	
	"Delete list" deletes a list from the list picker and the corresponding file. Works the same as the "Delete" function.
	Does not allow the deletion of the final list(one list must always be present).

	"Exit" synchronises the current list and the list picker and terminates the app.
